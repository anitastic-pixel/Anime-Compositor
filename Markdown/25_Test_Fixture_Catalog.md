# Test fixture catalog and tolerances

Version 0.2 | 2026-09-04 | Proposed baseline

## Fixture authority

This catalog binds test IDs to independent inputs, expected behavior and tolerances. The machine-readable subset is `Fixtures/fixture_manifest.json`. A production implementation may generate additional cases, but passing self-generated snapshots alone is insufficient.

## Numeric fixtures

| Fixture ID | Purpose | Input | Expected result / rule | Tolerance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FX-A-001 | transparent source-over | S=(0,0,0,0), D=(0.2,0.4,0.6,1) | D unchanged | 1e-7 CPU |
| FX-A-002 | opaque source-over | S=(0.8,0.1,0.2,1), any D | S | 1e-7 CPU |
| FX-A-003 | partial alpha over opaque | straight S=(1,0,0), As=.5; D=(0,0,1), Ad=1 | premul output=(.5,0,.5,1) | 1e-6 CPU |
| FX-A-004 | zero-alpha unpremultiply | C=(0,0,0), A=0 | straight RGB=(0,0,0), finite | exact |
| FX-B-001 | multiply opaque | red over 50% gray | B=(.5,0,0), A=1 | 1e-6 |
| FX-B-002 | screen opaque | .5 gray over .5 gray | .75 gray, A=1 | 1e-6 |
| FX-B-003 | add opaque | .7 + .6 gray | 1.0 clamped, A=1 | 1e-6 |
| FX-E-001 | exposure identity | e=0 | unchanged | 1e-7 |
| FX-E-002 | exposure +1 | RGB=.25, e=1 | RGB=.5; alpha unchanged | 1e-6 |
| FX-T-001 | tint zero | amount=0 | unchanged | 1e-7 |
| FX-T-002 | tint full | amount=1, alpha=.5 | straight RGB=tint; premultiplied by .5 | 1e-6 |

## Time fixtures

FX-TIME-001: exposure spans map composition frames 0..4 to drawing numbers `[1,1,2,2,2]` exactly through save, preview and export.

FX-TIME-002: sequence numbers `[1001,1002,1004]` with a requested 1003 produce `MEDIA_SEQUENCE_GAP`/missing drawing, not substitution.

FX-TIME-003: 24000/1001 remains the exact stored rate after round-trip; no replacement with decimal 23.976 authority.

FX-TIME-004: composition `start_frame=-12`, `duration=24` has valid frames -12 through 11 and exactly 24 export frames.

## Transform fixtures

FX-XF-001 identity preserves pixels and bounds. FX-XF-002 integer translation moves a 1x1 impulse exactly one pixel. FX-XF-003 half-pixel translation verifies bilinear weights. FX-XF-004 rotates around a nonzero anchor using the matrix order in 21.

## Persistence fixtures

`Fixtures/projects/minimal_project.json`: smallest valid project. `cel_holds_project.json`: explicit exposure spans. `unicode_paths_project.json`: non-ASCII display/path fields. `missing_media_project.json`: valid project with intentionally unavailable asset. `unknown_effect_project.json`: structurally valid unknown effect that must survive load/save with a warning.

## Failure fixtures

FX-IO-001 interrupted replacement retains last valid project. FX-IO-002 disk-full/write failure reports `PROJECT_SAVE_FAILED` and does not truncate the previous valid save. FX-MATTE-001 creates A->B and B->A matte references and must be rejected with `MATTE_CYCLE`.

## Image/filter fixtures

Gaussian blur uses a synthetic single-pixel impulse in a transparent image. Expected weights are independently generated from the normalized sigma/kernel definition in 21. Test symmetry, normalization, alpha behavior and expanded bounds.

Mask rasterization fixtures must record the exact rasterizer/reference tool once selected in B-06; until then, polygon interior/exterior topology tests are authoritative but subpixel edge goldens are OPEN.

## CPU/GPU comparison

Simple arithmetic: absolute per-channel error <= 1e-5. Filter operations: tolerance is declared per fixture after the independent CPU reference is implemented; default target <= 2e-5 for float output. Exported integer PNG tests compare decoded integer samples exactly where deterministic quantization is specified.

A backend that exceeds tolerance requires diagnosis. Do not loosen tolerances globally to hide a backend-specific error.

## Workflow fixtures

RSH-01 and RSH-02 are specified in 22. They are manually reviewed in addition to automated tests. Their visual acceptance cannot replace the numeric fixtures above.
