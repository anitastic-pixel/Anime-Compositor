//! D-115's drop shadow: document 21's rule, on a layer's own pixels.
//!
//! This program's own method, modelled on After Effects' Drop Shadow; nothing is ported.
//! `tools/drop_shadow_reference.py` is the same rule worked a second way, and
//! `tests/b58_drop_shadow.rs` holds this to its numbers.
